# react-app-setup

To use this script:

- Fork and clone the repo
- `cd` into the root directory of the repo `cd react-app-setup`
- In the root directory of the repo, run the command `chmod 755 setup.sh`

---

- ### Mac OS
  - Move the file to `/usr/local/bin` by running the command `mv setup.sh /usr/local/bin/setup`
- ### Windows
  - Move the file to `/c/Users/<YOUR_USER_NAME>/bin` by running the command `mv setup.sh ~/bin/setup`

---

- Verify the file is no longer in the repo folder by running `ls`
- You can now delete the repo

## Running the script

Similar to create-react-app, simply running `setup my-new-react-app` will create a new folder called `my-new-react-app` in your current directory.
